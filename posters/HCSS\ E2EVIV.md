- gigantic OO systems or duct taped scripts!

# what does the research community focus on?

- cryptographic protocols that preserve voter secrecy!
- new cryptographic constructs that enable new protocols!

- a few toy demonstration systems!

# gap analysis & current active work

- this is no certification for modern election systems
- few cryptographic protocols presume no trusted parties
- little research in usability and accessibility
- very little formalization of cryptographic protocols
- no high-assurance systems design and engineering
