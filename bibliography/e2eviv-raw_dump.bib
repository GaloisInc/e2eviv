abstract = {Due to recent changes of the election law of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, Germany, the counting of the votes at the next elections for the state parliament will be complicated and time consuming. To nevertheless enable the Election Supervisor to announce the preliminary results of the election on the evening of the Election Day the Parliament has chosen to make use of an electronic voting system, i.e. the Digital Voting Pen System (“Digitales Wahlstift-System” - DWS). The main reasons for favoring this electronic voting system have been its closeness to the conventional voting procedure and therefore its acceptance among the voters, its security, and its verifiability.},

abstract = {This paper discusses our approach to test programs that determine which candidates are elected in the Scottish Single Transferable Vote (STV) elections. Due to the lack of properties suited for model-based testing, we have implemented a reference implementation in a pure functional programming language. Our tests revealed issues in the law regulating these elections as well as the programs implementing the rules that are offered for certification. Hence, certification by testing with a reference implementation is able to reveal problems in the software to be certified. Functional programming languages appeared to be an excellent tool to implement reference implementations. The reference implementation was developed quickly and none of the differences found was due to an error in the reference implementation.},

abstract = {This report deals with the testing of eSTV software from ERS, Electoral Reform Services. The purpose of the test is to determine the conformance of eSTV to the WIG-rule [1]. In order to determine conformance we have created a new implementation of the rule in the functional programming language Clean [4]. Since this language uses a diﬀerent programming paradigm and the implementation is made completely independent from the software to be tested it is extremely unlikely that both implementations contain the same error. Testing is done by computing the election result for a given set of votes with both programs. The results of both programs are compared to the level of votes numbers after each selection and elimination step in the algorithm. This has shown to be a very sensitive test for very small variations in the algorithm used in the programs. These tests are executed for 808 standard test cases. These test cases are partly handcrafted or the vote distributions in real elections for similar voting rules. Each of these sets is computed with 4 diﬀerent elimination orders. In addition the results of 5000 generated data sets and a number of hand crafted data sets covering border situations in the algorithm are compared. Both test sets have shown to be very eﬀective to identify even the smallest changes in the algorithm to compute the result of the election. Testing of preliminary versions of eSTV showed some small inaccuracies in the program as well as some small space for diﬀerent interpretation of the rules. The Scottish Executive provided the ﬁnal interpretation of the rules (as detailed in section 7.1) and all test where repeated for eSTV version 2.0.16. In these ﬁnal tests there was an exact match for each of the 4 × 808 + 5000 = 8232 test cases.},
