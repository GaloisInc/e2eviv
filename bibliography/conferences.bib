                  between logic and category theory leading to a solid
                  basis for much of the understanding of the semantics
                  of computation. Notable amongst other advances is
                  the introduction of linear logic and other
                  substructural logics, providing a new approach to
                  proof theory. Further aspects covered are semantics

                  the 7th International Conference on Category Theory
                  and Computer Science, CTCS'97, held in Santa
                  Margheria Ligure, Italy, in September 1997. Category
                  theory attracts interest in the theoretical computer
                  science community because of its ability to
                  establish connections between different areas in
                  computer science and mathematics and to provide a
                  few generic principles for organizing mathematical
                  theories. This book presents a selection of 15
                  revised full papers together with three invited
                  contributions. The topics addressed include
                  reasoning principles for types, rewriting, program
                  semantics, and structuring of logical systems. },
