Many governments are considering how to incorporate computers in their voting
systems, lured in part by the promise of cheap, accurate vote counting. One way
is to have voters fill out a ballot using standard software and return it to the
government by email.

There is a lot to like about this system. Voters can vote from the comfort of
their own home, and email is much faster than regular mail for returning the
ballot. Email software is familiar and inexpensive, and potentially makes voting
accessible to some people who cannot vote today. Counting votes can be
automated, decreasing costs and human mistakes.

Unfortunately, the system also has serious security flaws. When you download a
file or send an email, the data flows through many untrusted computer systems.
The ballot can be intercepted or modified on the way to the voter, viruses on
the voter's computer can change the vote, or the vote can be changed on its
return trip to the government. If any one of these attacks works, it can change
the outcome of an entire election.

To prove that this is not just a theoretical danger, we have demonstrated that a
normal home wireless router can be taken over from anywhere on the Internet.
Afterwards, the router will silently modify emailed votes after they leave the
voter's computer but before they arrive at the government. The demonstration
took only a few days to develop, and could easily be made very difficult to
detect, even for security experts.

Despite its benefits, voting by email is deeply flawed. We must demand a system
where we can be confident that our votes are counted. Stay tuned for a
demonstration.
