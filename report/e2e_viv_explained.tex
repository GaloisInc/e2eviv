\label{chapter:e2e_viv_explained}

\tododmwit{signposting; some content is here, but we need an intro and
transitions explaining what content is about to happen}

Typical Internet voting election processes have six phases:

\begin{description}
  \item[Setup] During the setup phase, the election officials gather the
    information needed to run an election. This includes gathering
    registration information for all voters, identifying the issues and
    races that will be voted on, designing and specializing ballots,
    sending instructions and other information about the election to voters,
    and so on.
  \item[Distribution] Once the election has been set up, election officials
    must distribute ballots to the voters. Different voting system
    architectures use different mechanisms, including postal mail, email, or
    by having voters interact with a website\footnote{We distinguish between
    sending instructions to voters and distributing ballots; there is no
    hard and fast rule for the distinction, but a rule of thumb is that
    instructions are applicable to many voters, whereas anything that has
    been specialized for a single voter is part of the ballot and falls
    under the distribution phase.}.
  \item[Voting] Voters then fill out their ballots, often with the help of
    software installed on their own computers.
  \item[Casting] Filled out ballots are then returned to the election
    officials; as with distribution, different architectures use different
    mechanisms.
  \item[Tallying] The tallying phase includes the remainder of the election
    finalization tasks: counting votes and announcing the election outcome
    are common to almost every process, though some include other
    miscellaneous tasks like publishing certain information needed for
    audits.
  \item[Auditing] Some elections will inevitably be disputed; in such cases,
    there is a final phase in which interested parties look for evidence
    that the election outcome is correct (or not!).
\end{description}

One major concern for Internet voting involves ballot integrity during the
distribution, voting, and casting phases. For the election outcome to be
correct, it is important that the ballot that is received by and displayed
to the voter match the ballot that was created and sent by the election
officials; that the computer used to fill out the ballot faithfully reports
the intention of the voter; and that the filled out ballot be received by
the election officials exactly as it was when it was sent by the voter.
Typical Internet communications involve not just the computers owned by the
two parties communicating, but also many intermediary computers controlled
by neither party. A good election system needs to account for this, making
it impossible for these intermediates to intercept ballots for viewing or
modification during transit. Another concern is that voters computers are
rarely administered by experts, and as a result many of them are compromised
by outside forces. One consequence of this is that the voting phase itself
may become corrupted: even if the ballot arrives unchanged at the voter,
malware on the voter's computer may change the way the ballot is displayed
or the way the vote is recorded before casting the vote. It can be difficult
to design a system that is resistant to this kind of attack without
seriously sacrificing the usability of the system. Some systems use
alternative distribution mechanisms as cross-checks; for example, sending
something to the voter by postal mail which can be used to check that the
ballot displayed by their computer is correct.

To the extent that it is possible, it is desirable for Internet voting to be
private and anonymous. Voters should feel comfortable voting the way they
like (and not feeling pressured to vote for a particular candidate or to
vote a particular way on some issue); the fewer people who know or can find
out the way a given voter voted, the more comfortable they can feel. On the
other hand, election officials only want to record votes from people who are
registered to vote, and even then want to record only one vote from each
voter. Thus there is a tension during the vote casting phase between
retaining the anonymity of votes and ensuring that a vote is coming from
somebody who ought to be able to vote.

\tododmwit{ask Joe for a reference to the audit that showed that voting
terminal logs retained exactly who voted for what}
One popular approach to this problem in existing systems is to initially
require each vote to be tied to the voter who cast it long enough to decide
whether to include the vote in the later tally or not; then to keep the vote
but delete the information about who cast the vote. This approach can work;
however, audits of systems that take this approach shows that it is all too
easy to accidentally retain the connection between votes and voters longer
than intended, and make this information much more widely visible than
intended. From the privacy side of the tradeoff, it would be better if the
voter could be confident that there was no connection stored because the
information they send to the election officials during the casting phase
does not include any personally identifying material.

There is a subtle distinction being made here. We certainly want our
Internet voting systems to be correct, private, secure, and so forth. It is
important for the people developing these systems to verify that they are
correct and take an active role in seeking out and eliminating defects in
the system. But the goal of verifiable Internet voting is to go even
farther: not just correct, but \emph{visibly} correct. That is, it must be
possible for the parties using the system to be able to \emph{check} that
the system is behaving correctly, without trusting in the abilities of the
people who created the system to avoid bugs or trusting in the inability of
third parties to influence the behavior of the system. As applied to
anonymity: since it is not easy to prove to somebody else that you have
deleted some information, one must simply avoid giving them that information
in the first place. This theme---of being not just correct, but
verifiable---is one of the central ones of verifiable Internet voting, and
is a critical part of the defense against the software bugs, security
vulnerabilities, and sophisticated cybercrimes that history tells us are
sure to crop up.

\tododmwit{flesh out the next two paragraphs}
The verifiability theme also rears its head in vote tallying, where voters
may be interested in verifying that their vote has been recorded correctly
and included in the tally.

The goal of these individual concerns is to add up to a top-level property:
end-to-end verifiability. Cast as intended; recorded as cast; counted as
recorded.

\section{Shortcomings and Expectations of E2EVIV}
%As discussed in \autoref{chapter:remote_voting}, there are several
%difficulties with current voting processes: voters with disabilities cannot
%vote unassisted, communication channels with remote voters are slow and
%unreliable, vote tallying is labor-intensive and error-prone, and
%election audits are costly. Additionally, there is little visibility into
%the election process, meaning that individual voters and, in some cases,
%even auditors, must trust the reports of election officials and voting
%hardware vendors on election outcomes and processes. Election officials are
%naturally seeking technology that can mitigate these problems, such as
%automated, computer-based vote tallying to reduce tallying and auditing
%costs, computerized ballot completion with accessibility technology to
%assist disabled voters, Internet-based vote submission to increase the speed
%and reliability of communicating with remote voters, and cryptographic
%techniques for providing visibility without violating voter privacy. Below,
%we give an overview of the goals of these technologies, discuss their
%success at these goals, and highlight some common pitfalls.

\section{E2E VIV in Practice}

A number of practical voting systems have been developed based on the
principles of E2E VIV. This section describes several systems that
have been used in a real election or in a pilot.

\todoacf{Sort these somehow; make a timeline?}

\subsection{RIES~\cite{hubbers2004}}

RIES, the Rijnland Internet Election System, was first used in 2004 to
support elections to the Rijnland water management board,
supplementing the system of postal voting used by the water board. A
subsequent version was used to allow expatriate voters to participate
in the Dutch parliamentary elections \cite{gonggrijp2009}.

\subsubsection{Election Procedure}

\begin{itemize}

\item Before the election, credentials are mailed to every voter in
  the form of a very long number. The same mailing also includes
  instructions for the voter.

\item During the election, voters log into an election web site that
  includes a client-side voting application written in JavaScript. The
  client-side application encrypts the vote by passing the voter
  authorization code and the public ID of the candidate through a
  one-way function to create the encrypted vote. The encrypted vote
  is then placed on a public bulletin board that serves as a ballot
  box.

\item At the close of the polls, the election authority releases the
  final vote tallies along with a codebook containing the encryptions
  of all valid credentials with all candidate IDs.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Verifiability}

The algorithms and protocols used RIES are public, and each voter,
having access to all of the inputs and outputs, may (in principle)
check the computations. This is weaker than the desired individual
verifiability\todoacf{how/why?}, but nonetheless, far stronger than
conventional voting systems.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) sent
an election assessment team to observe the use of RIES in 2006. Their
report contains observations of critical security features of the
system that could not be observed \cite{osce2007}. Further
weaknesses were revealed by the Eindhoven Institute for the Protection
of Systems and Information (EiPSI) in 2008 \cite{hubbers2008},
notably that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the procedure of voter self-check is quite complicated,
  \item the two-channel (mail and Internet) voting makes system less
    transparent,
  \item too much power is given to the election administrator and the
    system's Internet host,
  \item issues arise when modifying the codebook due to a revoked
    ballot, and
  \item there are realistic ways to forge votes via cryptographic hash
    collisions.
\end{itemize}

One of the more important lessons learned through RIES is that when
voter authorizations are distributed long in advance of the election,
a mechanism must be provided allowing voters to obtain replacement
credentials and invalidate lost credentials. These mechanisms add
significant complexity to system, and is a source of some of the
problems reported in the OSCE and EiPSI reports.

Another feature of RIES rife with tradeoffs is the ability to perform
testing during the election: pre-invalidated test ballots are
deliberately added to the bulletin board in order to test the network
path from selected Internet clients to the server. While such testing
in principle can increase confidence in the election integrity, in
practice it opens the system to spoofing and denial of service
attacks. Furthermore in the RIES implementation the system is aware of
the fact that it is processing a testing ballot, and all of the test
ballots were voted identically from the same computer, limiting the
confidence added at the expense of these vulnerabilities.

In the wake of these critical reports, plans to use RIES in the 2008
Dutch parliamentary elections were scrapped, and Internet voting as a
whole was banned in the Netherlands.

\subsection{Prêt à Voter~\cite{chaum2005}}
\label{sec:pret-voter}

The state of Victoria in Australia held a governmental election in
November 2014, using a version of the Prêt à Voter
system~\cite{burton2012}. An attempt was also made to use Prêt à Voter
in a student election at the University of Surrey in February
2007~\cite{bismark2007}. The failure of this attempt illustrates many
of the pitfalls of adapting a research system to an actual election,
such as a short timetable, a lack of clear requirements, and the need
for rigorous implementation practices.

\subsubsection{Election Procedure}

Prêt à Voter uses two-part paper ballots with the candidate names on
one part and the voting targets plus a ballot ID number or barcode on
the other part.

\begin{itemize}

\item Before the election, the paper ballots are printed. Typically,
  the two parts are printed as a single sheet with a perforation to
  divide the sheet after voting.

\item From the voter's perspective, the order of the candidate names
  on the ballot appears to be random. The voter marks her choice next
  to the candidate name of her choice, separates the two parts of the
  ballot, and destroys the candidate names. She may take a copy of the
  voted part home for later verification.

\item For tabulation, there is a cryptographically secure mapping from
  the ballot ID numbers to the apparent random order of the candidate
  voting positions. Multiple custodians using a mixnet or similar
  technique use this mapping to decode cast ballots into anonymized
  plain-text ballots which are then posted to a bulletin board.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Verifiability}

Unvoted ballots may be audited before, during and after the election
to ensure that the decoding of cast ballots is being correctly
performed. Randomly selected stages in the decoding can be challenged
to prove the integrity of the count, and the plain-text decoded
ballots are easily counted for verification by any interested party.

An individual voter may also search for their voted ballot ID on the
bulletin board. This reveals the positions that were marked on that
ballot, but crucially, it does not show the corresponding candidate
names. The voter may therefore verify that the positions marked at the
polling place were correctly recorded by the election officials, but
because the voter no longer has the part of the ballot linking
candidate names to ballot positions, the voter cannot prove to anyone
else how the ballot was voted.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

Since there is no pre-election bulletin board posting of the valid
ballot IDs, there is potential for ballot stuffing by
insiders. This can be detected by cross-referencing polling place
data with the bulletin board after the fact, but that requires
additional trust in the poll workers.

\subsection{Punchscan~\cite{popoveniuc2006,popoveniuc2010punchscan}}
\label{sec:punchscan}

Punchscan was used for the graduate student association elections of
the University of Ottawa in 2007~\cite{essex2007}. It is likely
the first E2E voting system with ballot privacy used in a binding
election.

\subsubsection{Election Procedure}

The election experience for a Punchscan voter is very similar to that
of Prêt à Voter. The system uses a two-part paper ballot where the top
part has candidate names and candidate numbers (or letters) and the
bottom part has numbered (or lettered) voting targets. Holes punched
in the top part expose the voting targets below. The order of the
voting targets for each race appears random to the voter. Both halves
of the ballot bear an identical serial number.

The voter casts their vote by marking her choice with a bingo dauber,
and the two halves are separated. Either side can be scanned (since
the bingo dauber marked both through the hole and around it) as the
cast ballot. The other side is destroyed, and a copy of the cast side
may be retained by the voter.

\subsubsection{Verifiability}

A curious voter may inspect the public record of any cast ballot
exactly as with Prêt à Voter. It does not matter which half of the
ballot the voter retained, because there is no public display of the
numbers that link candidate names to voting positions; only the
position that was marked is displayed. Again, individual ballots may
be audited, and the key to tabulating the votes is that there is a
cryptographically secure mapping from the ballot serial numbers to the
apparent random order of the candidate voting positions.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

Punchscan elections rely on procedure to maintain many of its
desirable properties, much like Prêt à Voter. For example, during the
University of Ottawa elections, more ballots were cast than voters
recorded in the pollbook, showing that ballot stuffing can be caught
after the fact by poll workers, but is not an inherently verifiable
property of the system.


\subsection{Scantegrity II~\cite{chaum2008,chaum2009}}
\label{sec:scantegrity-ii}

Scantegrity II (Invisible Ink) was used in the Takoma Park, Maryland
municipal elections in 2009~\cite{carback2010}. In 2011, it was used
for in-person voting with Remotegrity (\ref{sec:remotegrity}) used for
absentee voting. The 2009 Takoma Park election was the first use of an
E2E system with ballot privacy in binding governmental elections.

\subsubsection{Election Procedure}

\begin{itemize}

\item Before the election, officials generate the seed to a
  pseudorandom number generator using a secret sharing
  scheme. Three-letter alphanumeric codes are created for each choice
  on each printed ballot using this seed, and additional tables are
  created so that interested parties can later confirm that the tally
  was computed correctly.

\item During the election, the voter experience is nearly identical to
  that of conventional optical-scan paper ballots. When the voter
  marks their choice, the ink in the pen reacts with invisible ink on
  the paper to disclose the three-letter code in the marked voting
  target. The ballot ID number and the displayed code are posted to a
  public bulletin board.

\item After the election, public verification of the final tally
  proceeds with the public bulletin board in a manner similar to that
  of Punchscan and Prêt à Voter.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Verifiability}

In addition to the public verification, an individual voter who takes
note of their ballot ID number and the code revealed from invisible
ink may use the public bulletin board to check that their ballot was
indeed tabulated, though this information is not sufficient to prove
that they voted a particular way.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

\todoacf{Roll this in with other analysis in \ref{sec:limit-exist-syst}}

\subsection{Remotegrity~\cite{zagorski2013}}
\label{sec:remotegrity}
Remotegrity is a remote coded voting system that was used for absentee
voting alongside Scantegrity (\ref{sec:scantegrity-ii}) for in-person
voting for the 2011 Takoma Park, Maryland municipal elections.

Remotegrity voters receive a coded voting ballot and an authentication
card in the mail. The codes on the ballot can be covered by a
lottery-style scratch-off field. The authentication card contains
several authentication codes under scratch-off, a lock-in code under
scratch-off, and an acknowledgment code. Both cards have serial
numbers. The voter can be sent two ballots so that she can use one for
auditing purposes.

To vote, the voter enters both serial numbers, the codes corresponding
to her choices, and an authentication code obtained after
scratching-off a surface chosen at random.

She returns to the election website a few hours later to check if her
codes are correctly represented, and to see if the election authority
has posted her acknowledgment code next to the codes. This indicates
to her that the election officials received valid codes for her
ballot.

She scratches off the lock-in code and posts it on the website. This
affirms to the election officials, observers and other voters that her
vote is correctly represented on the website.

Among all of the systems discussed here, this is the first one that
asks the voter to take positive action to confirm that the vote was
correctly posted.

As with RIES, if we assume that there is no communication between the
computer used to print the credentials and the computer used to
collect the votes, the latter computer does not know the mapping
from codes to candidates, so the vote is not revealed to the
computer. Further, because the computer does not know a valid code
corresponding to another candidate on the ballot, it cannot change the
vote. Finally, and uniquely, because the computer does not know the
acknowledgment code, its presence on the election website assures the
voter that the election officials received a valid code for her
ballot.

The tally is computed from the codes in a verifiable manner that
corresponds to the coded voting system used.

If a jurisdiction is nervous about using the Internet for remote
voting, Remotegrity ballots can be mailed in, and voters can check for
their codes on the election website to be assured that their vote
correctly reached election officials.

\subsection{Helios~\cite{adida2008,adida2009}}

Helios is a system developed for web-based Internet voting. It was
used for the election of a Belgian university president in March 2009
and by numerous universities and associations since then, including
the Association for Computing Machinery and the International
Association for Cryptologic Research.

\subsubsection{Election Procedure}

\begin{itemize}

\item Before the election, officials input the email addresses of the
  voters who will be participating. The system emails the voters their
  randomly-generated login information and the link to the election
  website.

\item During the election, the voter enters their choices on the
  website. After entering her choices, the voter has an option to
  spoil their ballot in order to verify that it was recorded
  correctly. Upon completing a non-spoiled ballot, the system sends an
  email confirming the receipt of their vote, though not their
  choices. At any time before the close of the election, the voter can
  repeat these steps and the new vote will replace the old vote.

\item After the election, Helios uses homomorphic vote tallying with
  the optional addition of mixers and mixnets in some
  derivatives~\cite{bulens2011,tsoukalas2013}.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Verifiability}

Voter authentication is not required until after the voter decides to
cast the ballot, so any interested party may prepare and audit
ballots. All cast ballots are posted in encrypted form on a public
bulletin board so that voters may check that their ballots have been
correctly recorded. Similarly, after the polls close, the decryption
and vote tally may be checked.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

Because officials can enter voters by email address, Helios provides
limited protection against insider ballot stuffing. Due to the
complexity of publicly auditing the election results, this would be
difficult to detect~\cite{orion2009}.

\subsection{Norwegian System~\cite{gjosteen2012}}

Between 2011 and 2014, the Norwegian government ran an Internet remote
voting trial using a cryptographic protocol designed by Scytl, a
commercial voting system vendor. Scytl and the Norwegian government
assert that this is an E2E system, which if accurate is the first
effort by commercial voting system vendors to enable E2E
elections.

\subsubsection{Election Procedure}

The Norwegian system uses a three-channel model involving postal mail,
the Internet, and SMS text messaging.

\begin{itemize}

\item Before the election, the voter receives authorization codes to
  cast a ballot via postal mail.

\item During the election, the voter uses a computer to cast an
  encrypted ballot. The voter can cast multiple ballots; only the
  last ballot cast is counted, and if a voter votes both on paper at a
  polling place and by Internet, the paper ballot overrides the
  Internet ballot. After casting a ballot, the voter receives a
  confirmation code offering a partial end-to-end proof via an SMS
  message.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Verifiability \& Analysis}

Available descriptions of the Norwegian system are incomplete, so it
is not possible to analyze the system in depth. However the system's
claims to protect voter privacy are weak: ``If the voter's computer
and the return code generator are both honest, the content of the
voter's ballot remains private.'' In addition, the receipt delivered
to the voter proves only that the encrypted ballot was received as
cast, not that it was counted as cast or that the encrypted vote
matches the voter's intent.

The system evolved significantly between its first use in 2011 and
2013, with added complexity to attempt to assure voters that their
ballots were stored as cast. In 2013, the Carter Center mounted a
serious effort to observe the Norwegian system in action. Their
report on the operation of the system and the problems
they had observing it offers useful insight into the administration of
E2E systems in general as well as the particulars of the Norwegian
system~\cite{carter2013}.

\subsection{Wombat~\cite{rosen2011}}

The Wombat voting system has been used for multiple pilot elections in
Israel. It is an in-person voting system where the voter votes on a
touch-screen and obtains a printout of her vote with an encryption of
it. The voter can choose to cast or audit the encrypted vote. If she
chooses to audit the vote, she may check if the vote was correctly
encrypted. If she chooses to cast it, the ciphertext is posted online,
and she casts the unencrypted vote in the ballot box (this may be
manually counted) and takes the ciphertext home. The votes are tallied
using a verifiable mixnet.

\subsection{DEMOS~\cite{kiayias2014}}

DEMOS is a coded vote system where the voter is given a two-part coded
ballot; she audits one part and uses the other to vote. Associated
with each choice on the ballot is

\begin{itemize}
\item a vote code---the encryption of the vote, which is entered in
  the voting machine by the voter, and
\item a receipt code which the voter does not enter, but which is
  posted online next to the vote code.
\end{itemize}

The voter can check the receipt to ensure her vote reached the
election authorities. The ballot also has a QR code containing all the
information on the ballot which can be scanned by the voter if she
prefers not to manually enter the vote code. Once the ballot is
entirely represented on the computer, the voter can then make her
choices. Note that if the voter scans the QR code, the scanning
computer knows how she voted. The vote codes represent homomorphic
encryptions of the votes and the verifiable tally is obtained in a
standard manner.

A pilot study of DEMOS was carried out in 2014.

\todoacf{This section should be filled in with material from
  history.tex and comparative\_analysis.tex, and then history.tex and
  comparative\_analysis.tex should be ``retired'' and their resources
  moved into e2e\_viv\_explained\_resources.}

\section{Limitations of Existing Systems}
\label{sec:limit-exist-syst}

E2E systems inherit many of the limitations of traditional voting
systems. Reliability of equipment, reliance on procedure, trust in
insiders, and accessibility are all problems with traditional
in-person voting systems. For remote systems, the integrity of postal
systems, turnaround time for mailed materials, access to Internet or
fax technology, and reliability of Internet servers are all
well-documented obstacles to voting. \todoacf{reference other sections
  about this}

Existing E2E systems mitigate some of these limitations. For example,
code voting limits the ability for attacks against postal mail systems
to change the candidates marked on voted ballots. However if an
attacker simply intercepts and destroys the voted ballot, a
replacement might not arrive in time for that voter to participate in
the election. To mitigate this, election officials might choose to
instead accept voted ballots via fax, email, or website, but such
expedient measures often trade off the verifiability that makes an E2E
system desirable in the first place.

In this section, we examine the limitations of E2E systems with a
particular focus on the limitations that are unique to or exacerbated
by E2E characteristics.

\subsection{Voter Secrecy}

Systems like Prêt à Voter (\ref{sec:pret-voter}) and Punchscan
(\ref{sec:punchscan}) rely on a randomized candidate order or a code
on printed ballots to ensure voter secrecy. Voted ballots must appear
on a public bulletin board in order to verify the election results,
and so to protect secrecy only the selected position or code is
visible on the final ballot along with a ballot ID.

If an insider is able to review the printed ballots before the
election, they can record how the candidate positions are arranged for
each ballot ID and therefore identify which candidate is marked on the
voted ballots, thus violating secrecy~\cite{burton2012}.

Recent writing on Prêt à Voter recommends printing ballots on demand
at polling places in order to limit this
possibility~\cite{ryan2009}. Printing on demand introduces additional
problems and expense compared to centralized printing. More printing
equipment is required at each polling place, that equipment can break
or be difficult to operate, and the printing equipment must have some
way of communicating with the rest of the election infrastructure to
ensure it has, for example, the correct cryptographic seeds for
generating new ballots.

Scantegrity II (\ref{sec:scantegrity-ii}) uses invisible ink to hide
the vote codes on unvoted ballots, and Remotegrity
(\ref{sec:remotegrity}) can use scratch-off fields to hide vote codes
and other information required to cast a ballot. These techniques
limit the opportunity for insiders to learn secrecy-compromising
information without being detected through the presence of a marked or
damaged ballot.

Even with techniques to mitigate insider foreknowledge of the ballots,
secrecy still can depend on voters and poll workers correctly
following procedures. A voter can leave the polling place with a
complete Prêt à Voter ballot, for example, failing to shred the half
with the candidate order. With both halves of their ballot, they can
prove how they voted, losing receipt-freedom.

RIES makes a deliberate secrecy tradeoff by weakening the
receipt-freeness requirement in exchange for providing universal
verifiability and a degree of individual verifiability. The results of
an entire election can be independently audited with only the
information publicly available after the election. However if a voter
discloses her credential or her encrypted vote, the same public
information may be used to violate ballot secrecy. The developers of
RIES judged this violation to be no more severe than the threats to
ballot secrecy inherent in postal voting, and therefore worth
accepting for the benefit to verifiability.

\subsection{Ballot Stuffing}

\todoacf{Flesh out these points}

Insiders can print or generate more ballots than there are voters.

Defense in most systems is to crossreference with polling place
counts. This depends on procedure being correctly followed rather than
something verifiable.

Publishing pre-election tables can help so that all votes in the final
result have an (anonymized) provenance. However this can make it
harder to replace lost, stolen, or spoiled ballots. Also same-day
registration increases turnout and requiring rolls ahead of time
precludes it.

\subsection{Infrastructure \& Equipment}

\todoacf{Flesh out these points}

Election equipment fails in practice. A true E2E system must be
resilient to failures while not giving up E2E properties. For example,
if a remote voting website fails, email should not be the backup
mechanism.

Verifiable election systems can require more sophisticated equipment
than traditional systems. For in-person voting, a verifiable system
might require ballots to be printed on demand, a high-quality shredder
for two-part ballots, and more sophisticated assistive devices.

Systems that post encrypted ballots during an election to a public
bulletin board are distributed systems. Depending on the networking
scheme this can open equipment to distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attacks, network partitions, inconsistency, and other problems
inherent to distributed systems.

Internet systems add to the difficulties of distributed systems by
requiring the systems to be accessible via the public Internet,
increasing the possibilities for DDoS and other malicious
attacks. Furthermore, many systems allow voters to use their own
computers to vote, leading to many potential problems: malware on the
voter's computer might undermine security, incompatibilites might
arise due to operating systems or web browser versions, and the
network infrastructure between the voter and the central election
system might be compromised with a man-in-the-middle attack.

\subsection{Support \& Responsiveness}

\subsection{Usability}

\todoacf{Flesh out these points}

Traditional election systems struggle with usability. Verifiable
systems add more steps and complexity, making usability even more
difficult. The mechanics of marking a ballot become more complex with
code voting as in Remotegrity, and position or shape matching as in
Prêt à Voter and Punchscan. Individual verification, not even possible
in traditional systems, is an entirely new process that voters must
master to take full advantage of E2E guarantees.

Usability of equipment by poll workers is also crucial. Traditional
systems' accessibility features, for example, are in practice often
unusable by poll workers and require specialized
expertise~\cite{runyan2007improving}.

Usability translates into confidence.

\subsection{Accessibility}

There are ability requirements for many E2E systems in various stages
of the voting process. For example, a sighted voter is able to see the
correspondence between candidate position and marking position on a
Punchscan ballot, but a non-sighted voter cannot without
assistance. In addition to obstacles to marking a ballot, some schemes with
individual verification lack provisions for disabled voters to
participate in individual verification without assistance. Information
required for verification is frequently delivered through a paper
receipt, an invisible ink code, or requires writing down receipt
data.

Accessible verification protocols have been proposed that take care to
protect voter secrecy and allow participation in individual
verification~\cite{chaum2009accessible}. However, these protocols
require using accessibility equipment with an audio, sip-puff, or
switch interface to read and mark the unencrypted ballot. The device
must therefore be trusted not to record the votes, which would violate
voter secrecy. The device must also represent the ballot faithfully to
the voter so that votes are recorded as intended.

Requiring trust in assistive devices is not unique to E2E
systems~\cite{runyan2007improving}. In non-E2E systems, though, trust
is already widely distributed. In the context of having to trust the
chain of custody of ballots, the integrity of poll workers, and the
outcomes of any audits, having to trust an assistive device is a
relatively small concession to make in an already-flawed system.

On the other hand, a well-designed E2E system requires a much smaller
base of trust for voters to have confidence in the results of an
election. By requiring an expanded base of trust in order to be
accessible, the existing E2E systems undermine their E2E properties.

\todoacf{Flesh out these points}

The public is reluctant to adopt E2E approaches when systems with
E2E properties fail during an election or are revealed to have
substantial integrity issues.

Novel systems face a difficult bootstrapping problem: in order to be
adopted in large-scale elections, they must have a successful track
record. However in order to build up that track record, systems must
be successful despite the limited resources available during
small-scale pilot programs. With limited resources, corners are cut in
the implementation of the election system leading to a greater chance
of problems with equipment, software, and support.

Broader computer security concerns are becoming topics of household
conversation with vulnerabilities like Heartbleed and droves of
personal data compromises making the headlines. These concerns rightly
make the public wary of any system with a computerized component, even
if the Internet is not involved.

It is difficult for the guarantees provided by an E2E system's
underlying cryptographic design to be understood and accepted by
voters without technological expertise.

Even when a voter wants to participate in individual verification, the
steps to do so are frequently too difficult or obscure.
