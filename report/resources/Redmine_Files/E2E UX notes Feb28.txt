Notes from Susan/Keith face-to-face working session in Ann Arbor, 2/28/14.

1. The PROJECT experience
a. Front end / outcome: a "report" and related activities, by various teams (usability, auditing, security), for Election officials (state, local, NASED, etc.). Also, indirectly for/about vendors.
b. Back end: the tools we use to communicate within the project team, write, collaborate, project management, …
- Redmine for project management - play with settings
c. OVF model: Data + Development + Dialog

2. Helios investigation - https://vote.heliosvoting.org/
a. Quick review show slots of potential for improvement. Project question: should we use this code to build prototypes for the project (vs. lower fidelity prototypes like paper)?
b. Mike H. to review quality of open source code, likelihood we could build better front ends on top for the project.
c. Keith to-do: A deeper analysis, generate list of questions based on what is there (like purpose of "Election Fingerprint" - less about UI review cuz UI is so bad, but around rationale for features)

3. Users of the proposed internet voting system (lunch brainstorming and discussion)
a. Election officials: set-up, auditing, support. Voting, but registration (online) also considered part of the system from their POV.
-- Adminsiter: Federal - state *** - local. Centralization admin at state level has many benefits.
-- Ballots: Federal - state - local.
b. Public - for auditing of election results (E2E criteria)
c. Hackers / bad guys - part of the system, design for BAD experience for them
d. VOTERS
-- Channels of communication: Snail mail, Fax, Telephone, Email, Http, SMS
-- Military - Military family - Civilian (e.g. focus on civilian, works for military?)
-- Technology / devices: Computer, Tablet, Smartphone
-- Abilities: Few…Lots. Alternate systems for some abilities (e.g., help at polling places)
-- Familiarity with tech: low..high (young…old) 
-- Experience with voting: first time (need explanations)….knows what to do/set in ways
-- Tech fundamentals: Paper, Digital, Both (compare voter views with Election Officials with security experts)
-- Physical location: Overseas…US. Some fear develop for overseas and then adopted for US.
-- Away from US timeframe: Temporary/short…Permanent/long
-- Election situation: Normal…disaster/special concerns.

4. US vote analysis (to compare with, supplement project)
a. Personas (home page carousel)
-- Traveling exec --> absentee
-- Students --> reminders, absentee, out of state
-- Overseas --> absentee, temporary vs. permanent
-- Implied disabled --> absentee, cannot get to polls
-- Poll-place-voter --> Voter reg, contact election officials
-- Busy/single parent --> choose to absentee, save time. Alternate: Double shift, overworked.
-- Military
b. Purpose of site includes awareness of overseas, military voters
c. Data from customer support
d. Roadmap for voter account services: aggregate data, as states do better

5. Web for Everyone Personas
a. Reviewed them on SkyDrive, incorporate into larger set of user descriptions, use as model for others
