This project and report would not have been possible without the
commitment and tireless hard work of the team at Galois, Inc. Our
special acknowledgment and appreciation goes most especially to Joseph
Kiniry, who brought his decades of knowledge, skill, experience, and
leadership to the project, broadened its scope and led the technical
team and writing; and with him, the Galois team members Daniel
Zimmerman, Daniel Wagner, Philip Robinson, Adam Foltzer, Shpatar
Morina, and Leah Daniels. We are indebted to CEO Rob Wiltbank for the
Galois engineering contribution and the long leash he gave to this
project.

We would also like to thank the research and technical members of the
E2E-VIV Project Team for their contributions to this project from its
conception to its completion, with special thanks to Josh Benaloh,
Candice Hoke, Keith Instone, David Jefferson, Doug Jones, Aggelos
Kiayias, Morgan Miller, Judy Murray, Ron Rivest, Barbara Simons, and
Poorvi Vora.

Equally vital and integral to this report were the reflections,
insights and advice from election officials who joined our team, most
especially Lori Augino, Judd Choate, Dana Debeauvoir, Mark Earley,
Stuart Holmes, Dean Logan, Tammy Patrick, Roman Montoya, and Lois
Neuman.  We also thank Sean Beggs, Randall Trzeciak, and Andrew
Wasser, Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College Master of
Information Systems Management for their support through the CMU ISM
Capstone Program.

We are grateful for the generous financial support of the Democracy
Fund, as well as their support of collaborative efforts in the realm
of civic tech development.
