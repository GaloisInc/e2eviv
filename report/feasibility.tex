\todokiniry{Introduction: frame entire report in terms of its coverage,
  main thrusts, action items, etc.}

\todokiniry{Reflect upon what factors play into determining if taking a
  next step on this work is feasible: technical aspects are security,
  usability, operational, availability, and non-technical aspects are
  law, politics, operational (from an LEO and SOS point-of-view), and
  fiscal.}

\todokiniry{Who determines feasibility?  What are the context in which
  such an assessment must take place?  Who is/are the aligners and who
  is the decider on a final determination?}

\todokiniry{Briefly summarize the main outstanding research and
  engineering challenges, as those are what a phase 2 of this project
  focuses upon.  We have little control over what legislators and
  legislators, LEOs, and SOSs decide in the coming years.}

\section{Technical Feasibility Analysis}

\todokiniry{If E2E-VIV is not technically feasible, then we are DOA.}

\subsection{Security}

\todokiniry{Core security challenges and their prospective solutions.
  Feasibility analysis from an engineering and operational
  standpoint.}

\subsection{Usability}

\todokiniry{Recall that this includes accessibility.  Reflect upon the
  split personality of the Demos protocol for usability for the
  typical set of voters.}

% Text to move starts here...

In order to effect these goals, a demonstration system that mimics a
voter's interaction with an E2E-VIV system has been developed by
Galois. That system is a variant of the STAR-Vote system designed by
Wallach et al.~\cite{star-vote}. STAR stands for Secure, Transparent,
Auditable, and Reliable. STAR-Vote is an end-to-end verifiable ballot
marking device. As such, it is not designed for, or meant to be used
for, Internet voting. But insofar as its voting process is identical
to that of most of E2E-VIV election schemes in the literature, we
decided to use it as a demonstration vehicle for usability and
accessibility experiments.

The Galois STAR-Vote implementation has a web-based UI, thus can be
used and demonstrated remotely for interactive and non-interactive
experiments to gather both qualitative and quantitative feedback.
Several variants of STAR-Vote have been implemented for UX testing.
These variants include simple changes---like different typeface
choices and sizes, background colors, supporting images, help text,
mouse pointer graphics, etc.---as well as more complex changes---like
different voter, challenge, and audit workflows.

In an interactive, qualitative experiment, a facilitator and a voter
communicate using a video chat system such as Skype and the voter
shares their desktop with the facilitator. Optimally, the facilitator
is someone who is deeply familiar with the issues of E2E-VIV systems,
is familiar with STAR-Vote, and has expertise in usability and
accessibility. The voter then uses (one of several variants of)
STAR-Vote, voicing their thoughts and feelings about their experience
in real-time. After the voter has completed their participation in the
demonstration election, the facilitator uses a script to query them
about their impressions.

For a non-interactive, quantitative experiment, voters will be
solicited via social media, mailing lists, etc. to experiment with
(variants of) STAR-Vote. Sample voters in these experiments are given
ample information about what kinds of information is being collected
about their behavior so that they can make a fully-informed judgement
about their participation.

Various quantitative measures related to voter participation and
interaction can be measured automatically, both within their web
browsers and on the STAR-Vote server. Most of this data is akin to the
analytics that any professional website collects about its users: How
do voters navigate the site?  Where does a voter pause for a long time
and read?  When does a voter ask for help?  When does a voter hover
over a button a long time before they decide to click it?  How often
do voters challenge ballots or verify their votes?  How often do
voters examine the bulletin board?  Is there a correlation between the
interactive behavior of a voter while voting and their likelihood of
voting, challenging, or auditing correctly?

\subsection{Availability}

\todokiniry{Reflect upon the current state-of-the-art in providing
  availability for core services on the internet.  How expensive and
  difficult is such a deployment?  Do the more radical architectures
  described earlier provide serious alternatives?}

\subsection{Operational}

\todokiniry{What are the feasibility challenges in operationalizing an
  E2E-VIV product or service?}

%=====================================================================
\section{Non-Technical Feasibility Analysis}

\todokiniry{If E2E-VIV it is technically feasible, and yet the law,
  politics, or boots-on-the-ground deep it infeasible, then it is
  DOA.}

\subsection{Law}

\todokiniry{Ensure we discuss other legal frameworks; e.g., caselaw, SOS
  directives, national law and policy wrt the use of federal funds,
  etc.}

\subsection{Politics}

\todokiniry{In the main, politicians want internet voting come hell or
  highwater.  How does phase 2 and 3 look given that vendors are
  selling product and that politicians do not care about nuances?}

\subsection{Operational}

\todokiniry{Pay attention particularly to LEO considerations.  They want
  a product that is double-click deployable, integrates with their
  existing EMSs, and is easy and cheap to maintain and deploy,
  primarily through a set of competitive companies that provides
  various SLAs.}

\subsection{Fiscal}

\todokiniry{Reflect upon the cost of previous experiements in developing
  and trialing internet voting systems.  What is the current static
  state-of-affairs wrt election budgets at the local, state, and
  national level. There is little more HAVA money, jurisdictions are
  having to make-do with what they have, and there is little appetite for
  purchasing new equipment from the existing vendors that they
  dislike.  They really want an inexpensive outsourced product that is
  secure and usable.}

\subsection{Research}

\todokiniry{What are the open research challenges?  Crafting a custom E2E
  VIV protocol which pays attention to practical security,
  development, deployment, and usability.  A long-term UX study
  framework for running dozens/hundreds of microstudies to find the
  right story of E2E-VIV for the masses.}

\subsection{Development}

\todokiniry{How feasible is to to design and develop a high-assurance E2E
  VIV using modern tools, technologies, and theory?}

\subsection{Operational}

\todokiniry{How feasible is integration with local election systems and
  processes, especially given how many jursidictions have rolled their
  own EMSs?}

%=====================================================================
\section{Integrated Feasibility Analysis}

\todokiniry{Roll together the above analysis into a final overall
  framework for determining feasibilty and make a recommendation.}
