\label{chapter:feasibility}

\todojrk{Introduction: frame entire report in terms of its coverage,
  main thrusts, action items, etc.}

\todojrk{Reflect upon what factors play into determining if taking a
  next step on this work is feasible: technical aspects are security,
  usability, operational, availability, and non-technical aspects are
  law, politics, operational (from an LEO and SOS point-of-view), and
  fiscal.}

\todojrk{Who determines feasibility?  What are the context in which
  such an assessment must take place?  Who is/are the aligners and who
  is the decider on a final determination?}

\todojrk{Briefly summarize the main outstanding research and
  engineering challenges, as those are what a phase 2 of this project
  focuses upon.  We have little control over what legislators and
  legislators, LEOs, and SOSs decide in the coming years.}

%=====================================================================
\section{Technical Feasibility Analysis}

\todojrk{If E2E VIV is not technically feasible, then we are DOA.}

\subsection{Security}

\todojrk{Core security challenges and their prospective solutions.
  Feasibility analysis from an engineering and operational
  standpoint.}

\subsection{Usability}

\todojrk{Recall that this includes accessibility.  Reflect upon the
  split personality of the Demos protocol for usability for the
  typical set of voters.}

\subsection{Availability}

\todojrk{Reflect upon the current state-of-the-art in providing
  availability for core services on the internet.  How expensive and
  difficult is such a deployment?  Do the more radical architectures
  described earlier provide serious alternatives?}

\subsection{Operational}

\todojrk{What are the feasibility challenges in operationalizing an
  E2E VIV product or service?}

%=====================================================================
\section{Non-Technical Feasibility Analysis}

\todojrk{If E2E VIV it is technically feasible, and yet the law,
  politics, or boots-on-the-ground deep it infeasible, then it is
  DOA.}

\subsection{Law}

\todojrk{Ensure we discuss other legal frameworks; e.g., caselaw, SOS
  directives, national law and policy wrt the use of federal funds,
  etc.}

\subsection{Politics}

\todojrk{In the main, politicians want internet voting come hell or
  highwater.  How does phase 2 and 3 look given that vendors are
  selling product and that politicians do not care about nuances?}

\subsection{Operational}

\todojrk{Pay attention particularly to LEO considerations.  They want
  a product that is double-click deployable, integrates with their
  existing EMSs, and is easy and cheap to maintain and deploy,
  primarily through a set of competitive companies that provides
  various SLAs.}

\subsection{Fiscal}

\todojrk{Reflect upon the cost of previous experiements in developing
  and trialing internet voting systems.  What is the current static
  state-of-affairs wrt election budgets at the local, state, and
  national level. There is little more HAVA money, jurisdictions are
  having to make-do with what they have, and there is little appetite for
  purchasing new equipment from the existing vendors that they
  dislike.  They really want an inexpensive outsourced product that is
  secure and usable.}

\subsection{Research}

\todojrk{What are the open research challenges?  Crafting a custom E2E
  VIV protocol which pays attention to practical security,
  development, deployment, and usability.  A long-term UX study
  framework for running dozens/hundreds of microstudies to find the
  right story of E2E VIV for the masses.}

\subsection{Development}

\todojrk{How feasible is to to design and develop a high-assurance E2E
  VIV using modern tools, technologies, and theory?}

\subsection{Operational}

\todojrk{How feasible is integration with local election systems and
  processes, especially given how many jursidictions have rolled their
  own EMSs?}

%=====================================================================
\section{Integrated Feasibility Analysis}

\todojrk{Roll together the above analysis into a final overall
  framework for determining feasibilty and make a recommendation.}
