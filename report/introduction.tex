\section{The E2E VIV Project}
\label{sec:e2e-viv-project}

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Situation}
\label{sec:situation}

In March 2013, Overseas Vote Foundation’s President and CEO began a
discussion with a small group of experienced election integrity
technology advocates about how, if faced with having to specify an
Internet voting system, they would respond. Despite their concerns
about the security of Internet voting efforts to date, it was
nonetheless agreed that taking on the question was crucial at the
time.

Gridlock around Internet Voting is not unique to Washington
politics. Across the U.S., the scientific community, federal agencies,
cyber security specialists, and certain organized activists have
strongly advised against exposing the ballots of the most powerful
nation on earth to the seemingly endless range of cyber threats which
run rampant on today’s Internet.

Nevertheless, faced with ongoing challenges to serve their
constituencies in modern and efficient ways, and having experienced
the everyday efficiencies of technology throughout their lives, when
seeking new and improved election systems, election officials often
want to consider Internet-based technologies. In the current climate
of economic austerity, innovation in elections is rare. Our election
officials are trapped in a technology no-man’s land; they continue to
devote scarce resources to support outdated voting systems, while
lacking the means to certify the new voting systems they would like.

Election integrity advocates cite that secure, tested, certified
remote voting systems that election officials envision aren’t
available. The scientific community does not consider online ballot
return systems secure, nor are they certified. As a result, email has
become the default stopgap method for moving ballots online, although
it does not provide any of the benefits that a secure, full-featured
voting system would provide. Email is demonstrably insecure, yet
election officials and voters are using it regularly to transmit
ballots because viable alternatives are not available. Examination of
new and better ways to use technology to meet specific voting needs,
such as those of remote overseas citizens, military members, and
people with disabilities is needed.

Existing vendors of Internet voting technologies, whose systems are
neither tested nor certified, would like to openly market and sell
their systems within the U.S. and not face the resistance of the
election integrity advocates. No agreement on how to proceed, a
years-long history of mediocre attempts, ongoing animosity between
stakeholder parties, and a general lack of research on the current
questions are among the challenges of this situation.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{A Proposed Solution}
\label{sec:proposed-solution}

Within this climate, a project proposal was written and funding
provided by the Democracy Fund, a Washington D.C.-based philanthropic
organization whose stated objective is to “...invest in organizations
working to ensure that our political system is responsive to the
priorities of the American public and has the capacity to meet the
greatest challenges facing our country.” The proposal envisioned a
project to examine the future of voting and how it might be executed
securely online; one that approached the question of Internet-voting
from a research perspective, and that sought to fill in the gaps of
the many open questions plaguing the discussion.

According to Joe Goldman, Director of the Democracy Fund, “The
significance of this project will be in its ability to break open the
conversation from its current stalemate and include all sides in a
constructive project to openly examine and research what is really
needed by voters and election officials, and to determine whether this
form of voting can meet those needs and still guarantee security of
the election. Equally important, it will identify potential trade-offs
and shortcomings that represent the diverse range of values we hold
dear in our elections.”

On December 19, 2013, Overseas Vote Foundation\footnote{Since the
  start of the study, Overseas Vote Foundation has been renamed as
  “Overseas Vote”, an initiative of U.S. Vote Foundation.} (OVF), a
nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to overseas and military
voter participation, announced the launch of this project as the
End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting: Specification and Feasibility
Assessment Study (E2E VIV Project). Our stated aim is to examine a
form of remote voting that enables a so-called “end-to-end
verifiability” (E2E) property. For this study, we have assembled a
unique team of experts in computer science, usability, and auditing
together with a selection of local election officials from key
counties around the U.S.

We have focused our efforts to produce a system specification and set
of testing scenarios, which if they meet the requirements for
security, auditability, and usability, would then be placed in the
public domain. At the same time, we intend to demonstrate that
confidence in a voting system is built on a willingness to verify its
security through testing and transparency.

There is a historical misunderstanding in the U.S. election community
that the E2E VIV Project aims to correct. Our country’s foremost
scientists are not against technology advancements, nor are they
inherently at odds with the election officials who seek technology
improvements to meet their administrative challenges. Rather, that the
U.S. scientific community is skeptical of unproven claims of security
regarding existing systems that are not publicly tested or vetted. This
study aims to break this impasse and reconcile these concerns.

The scientific leaders on this project have often pointed out security
vulnerabilities in past systems. If Internet Voting (IV) can happen,
it must be in a system that takes advantage of end-to-end
verifiability and auditability.
% however the E2E VIV Project has led
% us to agree that Internet Voting (IV) can happen, but that it must be
% in a system that takes advantage of end-to-end verifiability and
% auditability. 

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Definition}
\label{sec:definition}

The term ``end-to-end'' is often used casually, without a precise
definition in mind. For the purposes of this study, E2E verifiability
is a property of an election system and can be split into two
sub-properties:
% with important components: 
\begin{itemize}
\item voters can individually check that their ballots are cast as they
intend
\item anyone can check that all of the cast ballots have been
  accurately tallied\footnote{Definition from Dr.~Josh Benaloh, Senior
    Cryptographer at Microsoft Research.}.
\end{itemize}
Note that it should be possible to perform the above checks even in
instances where election officials do not follow procedures and there
are errors or malware in voting technology.

While systems of this nature have been developed in the past, none
have been broadly used or successfully commercialized; the E2E VIV
Project has made a concerted effort to be informed by these past
efforts and build upon them as appropriate. Usability factors were
also considered from the outset of the study to address the
significant challenges faced by remote voters and voters with
disabilities when using such systems. This study is intended to enable
development efforts in E2E systems that are viable with respect to
security, auditability, and usability.

For those concerned with election integrity, there is a justifiably
negative reflex in response to IV: it takes all of the problems with
current remote voting systems and adds all of the problems and
security vulnerabilities of the Internet.  The E2E VIV Project has
sought to make the case that
% use of the Internet enables and
% facilitates the introduction of E2E-verifiability (E2EV), and that 
the benefits of E2EV may address some of the vulnerabilities
introduced by the use of the Internet.

No participant in this project discounted the concerns of voting over
the Internet, nor do we view E2EV as a magic sauce that makes the
Internet secure. Nevertheless we believe that E2E properties are quite
relevant to IV, since when these properties are achieved, it is
independent of whether votes are cast on untrusted devices like PCs or
transmitted over an untrusted medium such as the Internet.

The E2E VIV Project does not attempt to make the Internet
secure. Instead, we examine how E2EV negates many (although not all)
of the risks of voting via the Internet while introducing substantial
new benefits that are not found in currently deployed voting systems.

%=====================================================================
\section{Goals and Objectives}
\label{sec:goals-objectives}

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Shared Goals}
\label{sec:shared-goals}

Election officials and scientists involved in elections \textbf{share}
the overall goals: that voting systems can be proven secure,
auditable, verifiable, and accessible.

This project shows that the the scientific community cares deeply
about addressing the needs and requests of election officials as they
serve remote voters, that they have a great motivation to address
these questions when given a constructive opportunity to do so, and
that they would like to work together, not at opposite ends, to
examine the possibilities in this realm.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Project Goal}
\label{sec:project-goal}

Our goal is to specify and define a system and its testing scenarios
for an online voting method that can provide both security and
confidence to voters that their selections are accurately recorded and
counted. Our assertion is that E2E-verifiability negates many,
although not all, of the risks of voting via the Internet while
introducing substantial new benefits that are not found in
currently-deployed voting systems.

The project team presumes that if E2E VIV is a possible answer, or a
step toward one, we will find out and we will see if it can answer the
needs of many voters and election officials. If not, we will still
gain specific knowledge about the shortcomings, which will serve as a
starting point for future work.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Additional Objectives}
\label{sec:addit-object}

Our core objectives also include presentation and discussion of the
report with key stakeholders, integrating their feedback, and
garnering their acceptance of the report (see \autoref{sec:success}).

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Deliverables}
\label{sec:deliverables}

The main deliverable of the E2E VIV Project is the development of a
``whole product solution'' specification (or simply ``specification''
for short) for a trustworthy E2E VIV election system.

We have produced a report presenting a system specification to create
a secure E2E VIV system, a set of testing specifications to
demonstrate the security, a set of guidelines for system usability,
accessibility, and testing. Additional topics and analyses may be
considered and discussed in the report, such as legal and
administrative challenges, and ballot secrecy, privacy, and
confidentiality.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{A First Step}
\label{sec:first-step}

This project represents step one in an examination of whether one day
E2E VIV might be possible. Our current plan is to examine the
potential for an E2E VIV remote voting system together with election
officials, taking into close account their needs and the needs of
disabled voters. If a system can one day be developed based on these
principles, then we want to know. We need the answers that this
project will bring before we can say whether we, or anyone, will build
any new system. A viable outcome of this study with respect to
security, auditability, and usability will enable development efforts
to ensue.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Success}
\label{sec:success}

Beyond the concrete outcomes of this project, the fact that this
project takes a research and testing-based approach to a problem that
has been “in stalemate mode” will, we hope, stimulate election
development overall. The election industry is operating in a
traditional paradigm with only a few vendors able to survive despite
demand to move away from outdated, expensive, hardware-oriented
solutions.

We would consider it a success to produce a specification for a
usable, secure E2E-verifiable remote voting technology, to identify
its strengths and weaknesses and reasons to pursue or not pursue this
approach to remote and/or disabled citizen voting.

However, from the beginning it has been clear that if the project
determines that current techniques are weak and should not be pursued,
this would be a different outcome, but also one with many useful
implications.

A complete success for this project would be to produce a
specification that is: 1)~supported by the vast majority the expert
teams, including the technical, usability, testing, and research
teams; 2)~endorsed by the vast majority of the advisory council, and;
3)~endorsed by the major stakeholders in elections administration as
represented by the project's local election officials.

Additionally, the E2E VIV Project expects to receive support and
endorsement from many members of the electronic voting activism
community, as represented by key members of the Election Verification
Network and the Verified Voting Foundation.

The specification will be of a form with sufficient detail such that
the following requirements are fulfilled:
\begin{description}
\item[Independent Implementation] The specification must be of
  sufficient detail and clarity that an implementation of the election
  system must be possible by an independent party without extensive
  dialog with participants in the project.
\item[Independent Validation] It must be possible for a moderately
  proficient IT expert to objectively determine, in a reasonable time
  frame with reasonable cost, whether a constructed election system
  fulfills the specification.
\item[Evidence-Based Decisions] Every decision made in the crafting of
  the specification must be objectively justifiable and the evidence
  for the decision must be traceable.
\end{description}

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}

The original project was tightly limited to involve system
specification and testing only. No system development was envisioned
in this phase beyond mock-ups to help test usability. However, this
changed early on in the project when Joe Kiniry of Galois, Inc. came
on board to manage the project and its team.

The Galois engineers brought significant expertise to the project and
set about developing a set of rigorous engineering artifacts,
``demonstrators'', fit for refinement into a working election system,
and against which third parties can perform independent validation and
verification. According to Galois, demonstrators are technical
artifacts from the point of view of definition and constructions, but
non-technical artifacts from the point of view of
demonstration. Galois suggests that all demonstrators developed using
Galois IR\&D funding be:
\begin{itemize}
\item developed in a completely transparent and public fashion within
  the Galois GitHub Organization,
\item cross-referenced, and thus traceable to and from, all
  specification aspects (from domain models to behavioral design
  specifications),
\item replicated into the E2E VIV GitHub Organization, and
\item licensed under either a mainstream Open Source license with a
  strong community or an alternative license tuned to the elections
  community.
\end{itemize}

Significantly, Galois is a leader in the process of computing on data
while it remains encrypted, and in the automated generation,
validation and synthesis of high assurance cryptographic
solutions. They excel in multiple areas of cryptographic
implementation and secure-by-construction software, all of which can
be applied to the challenge of developing secure and usable E2E VIV
voting.

The relevance of Galois’ work to the project is clear: applying
cutting-edge computer science and mathematics to solve difficult
technological problems is needed to solve the secure, verifiable
election systems development challenge. Galois’ management agreed to
donate a significant portion of engineering time to the project in
order to build “demonstrators” that would be used to prove the
concepts of E2EV and to further examine security and usability.

\section{People}
\label{sec:people}

The E2E VIV Project is an opportunity to combine the abilities,
knowledge, experience and expertise of a diverse group of
technologists, computer scientists and election officials involved in
election integrity together to form the overall project
team. Technical, usability, testing and local election official
sub-teams were formed for ease of communication. The technical team
has decades of experience in E2E technology, cryptography, usability,
and testing. An Advisory Council was established to broaden the
communication with interested members of the election community.

Overseas Vote Foundation (OVF), as the official grantee, was
responsible for the overall project conception, proposal development,
presentations, communications, management, team recruitment,
contractual obligations, public relations, events and budgeting. Deep
experience in the arena of overseas and military voting, absentee
voting, community building, voter survey research, election reform and
communications gave OVF a unique edge in managing the project.

Galois, Inc. provided the technical and engineering project
management. Named as the technical project manager, Dr.~Joseph Kiniry,
working as a Principal Investigator at Galois, facilitated the
communication and decision-making of the expert teams. He became the
main author and editor of the report and ran all engineering projects
and usability aspects of the study.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Stakeholder Groups}
\label{sec:stakeholder-groups}

Although not on the official project team, there are several
communities relevant to the E2E VIV Project outside of those
represented on the expert teams, and interaction with members of these
communities has been essential. These communities include the
following overlapping cohorts.

\paragraph{Election verification advocates.} Election verification
advocates are plentiful, well-informed, and strongly connected.  They
care deeply about election integrity and verifiability, and
unsurprisingly Internet voting is a hot-button issue for many of them.

This skeptical attitude is compounded by the fact that several vendors
have developed Internet voting products which are proprietary,
closed-source, have never seen a public audit, and are
unverifiable. Moreover, many of these vendors make specious claims
about the security of their products---claims which the advocate
community rejects entirely. Finally, many vendors advocate outsourcing
elections entirely to them---a condition that will never be acceptable
to the advocate community, even for an end-to-end verifiable Internet
voting system.

A small number of advocates are \textbf{for} verifiable Internet
voting, a small number are adamantly \textbf{against} Internet voting
of any kind, but the bulk of advocates are on-the-fence. That majority
recognize that there are significant scientific and engineering
challenges in designing and developing a Internet voting
system. Moreover, they recognize that the decision to deploy such a
system is very much a subjective, political one. For example, in some
contexts, it is viewed as perfectly acceptable to use a
non-verifiable, outsourced election apparatus (such as Everyone
Counts' product); say for the voting of the winner of a reality
show. But for government elections of any value, such an option is
unacceptable to virtually every advocate.

Consequently, being fully transparent with---and listening to the
feedback from---the election verification advocate community is
absolutely mandatory. If the bulk of that community is not swayed by
the evidence presented in this report, pursuing any next phase in this
project will be fraught with turmoil and will be an uphill battle
against a number of influential actors, all with good intentions.

\paragraph{Standards Bodies.} Perhaps surprisingly, there is little
national or international standardization in the area of elections.  A
nascent effort to begin standardizing data interchange formats began a
decade or so ago and eventually fizzled after only producing one
small standard.

There are a myriad of reasons why this first effort failed. Vendors
lobby against, and are disinterested in, interoperability. The EAC's
Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) are not geared toward a
component-based approach to system design, thus there is little cause
for defining interfaces and data file formats, since devices cannot be
plugged together. Finally, there was insufficient buy-in from the
election research community.

In 2015 though, this situation changed with the rebirth of the
IEEE~1622 committee focusing on elections. The IEEE Voting System
Standards Committee~1622 (VSSC/1622) is creating standards and
guidelines around a common data format for election data. The aim is
that future election equipment used in U.S. elections and abroad can
interoperate more easily. It is the intention of the VSSC that
standards and guidelines being developed will be required in future
versions of the EAC's VVSG.

Many of the top researchers, election advocates, and election
officials in the world are a part of this committee. Additionally,
representatives from the major election systems vendors are either
participating, or listening in, because they recognize that
interoperability will be mandated by future versions of the
VVSG.\footnote{Recall that all election systems in the U.S.A. must be
  certified at the State or Federal level according to the EAC's
  voting system testing and certification standards, standards which
  mandate compliance with the VVSG.}

Standards are critical to any future work on E2E VIV systems for
several reasons.  First, given the compositional nature of most E2EV
election systems' designs, it is not unreasonable to expect that
different subsystems will be created and supported by different
organizations.  Second, in order to effect arbitrary third party
verification, clearly defined common data formats must be used.
Third, at some point in the future, if E2E VIV systems are accepted in
the mainstream, they must be certified by the EAC.  As such, EAC,
NIST, and IEEE standards must recognize their core capabilities,
subsystems, interfaces, and what constitutes legitimate evidence of
correctness and security. Moreover, it is sensible to presume that
there should be a standard means by which these aspects and evidence
are documented to expedite a sound, accurate, and expedited
certification process.

\paragraph{Vendors.} Vendors relevant to this project come in two
forms: (1)~existing vendors of proprietary election systems and
(2)~future vendors that support open source election systems.

Existing vendors are significantly interested in the results of this
project, particularly if it moves to a second phase that focuses on
the design and development an open source system.

Obviously those that have an existing non-E2EV internet voting product
(e.g., Scytl, Dominion, and Everyone Counts) will benefit from this
work, whether that attention is justified or not. Any increase in
attention on---or any hint of support from the verifiable elections
activist community about---internet voting aligns with their marketing
goals.

Additionally, vendors can use the requirements herein in good and bad
ways. We are hopeful that they will actively and positively absorb the
recommendations of this report and engage with any future phase of
this work.

From an optimistic perspective, if vendors read and understand the
report and its recommendations, then they can closely track the work
of the (provisional) next phase of this project. Any investment they
make towards making their commercial systems end-to-end secure and
verifiable---so long as there is publicly verifiable evidence of such
improvements---would be welcome by the bulk of the research and
activist communities.

The pessimist will argue that vendors will simply use these
requirements as a checklist, making specious claims that their systems
are E2EV, but provide no evidence of such.

Time will tell which of these paths each existing vendor will choose
to take.

The other kind of vendor that is relevant to this project does not yet
exist: vendors which support open source election systems in manifold
ways. Within the open source ecospheres---like those surrounding
operating systems like Linux, blog platforms like WordPress, and
content management systems like Drupal---there are a pluripotent
variety of companies that support these platforms: value-added
resellers, integrators, hosting facilities, hardened software stacks,
etc. Most of the companies provides provide commercial support for
open source products at a variety of service levels, either via a
subscription service or using a release-based license model.

We expect that a similar flowering of commercial support organizations
must come to exist to support any E2E VIV system that results with
this project as its genesis. It is important to note that these
organizations need not become experts in the underlying cryptography,
formal methods, or usability and accessibility. The high-assurance
development method proposed in this report results in validation and
verification artifacts that are evidence-generating for correctness
and security properties.  Additionally, modern formal system
specification languages support traceability from requirements to
evidence. 

Consequently, any future mission-critical E2E VIV system is robust to
integration, customization, or evolution work by these different kinds
of support vendors. That is to say, any future E2E VIV system
developed according to the requirements and recommendations herein
cannot be accidentally or purposefully broken without third parties
detecting the certification failure. It is only by virtue of having
these complete, consistent, traceable, evidence-generating artifacts
can such a blossoming of support vendors come to exist.

\paragraph{Hackers and Hacktivists.} Hackers and election hacktivists
are an important audience for this project. On the one hand, hackers,
constructively or destructively, help make open source systems more
secure.  Hacktivists, on the other hand, catalyze movements of
like-minded technical individuals. Across the world, their attention
has brought to light the flaws of insecure and incorrect electronic
voting systems (e.g., in The Netherlands).

Within these subcommunities, it is an undisputed truth that the design
and development of a secure used for public good must be open source
and must witness critique and improvements from the public. Leveraging
that attention is especially valuable for nationally critical systems
like public elections.

Consequently, it is our expectation that direct engagement with these
cohorts, from the Chaos Computer Club to Anonymous, while potentially
tempestuous at times, is wise and will have manifold pay off.

\paragraph{Election Officials.} Local elections officials (LEOs) are
the core stakeholder in the design and deployment of E2E VIV
technologies.  As such, not only must we pay attention to our expert
LEOs on the project, but we must solicit feedback and reflections from
any election official, past or present, who can give voice to their
jurisdictions, and its voters, needs.

There are over 10,000 elections jurisdictions in the U.S.A.; and there
are consequently over 10,000 different ways that elections are
run. Smoothly integrating with existing election processes is
important. Base issues like common data formats and API integration
are simple technical challenges that have straightforward, though
potentially politically delicate, solutions.

The enormous plurality of technologies, large and small, at the
federal, state, and local level make for difficult deployment of any
new election technology. It is clear that traditional IT practices for
the design, development, and maintenance of election software cannot
work in this setting. No vendor can support 10,000 forks of a single
code base to support 10,000 clients with slightly different
requirements. This state-of-affairs leads to some of our technical
recommendations, particularly those that touch upon feature modeling
and software product lines.

More subtle challenges, like ensuring that election officials
uncomfortable with technology can deploy and support a E2E VIV system
for their UOCAVA and disabled voters, have little to do with technical
solutions. These problems and solutions have more of a social,
political, and psychological root, and thus require ``soft''
solutions.

Artifacts like documentation and tutorials, webcasts and screencasts,
reports and demonstration software only go so far. An open supportive
community must exist around E2E VIV.  This community may be realized
in several ways.  In the Open Source world, it is common to see
friendly online forums for newbies spring up and regularly scheduled
and community-organized developer and user conferences.  Moreover, we
expect to see a wellspring of companies ready and willing to support
LEOs, ranging from value-added resellers to integration partners, as
discussed above.\footnote{For several examples of these communities,
  look no further than those that spring up around Linux
  distributions, Content Management Systems, blog platforms, wiki
  platforms, etc.}
  
As we exit phase one of this project and, speculatively, move to phase
two, a wide range of elections officials must be actively engaged in
the design and deployment of E2E VIV technology, and we must foster
the formation of a healthy, active, and supportive community,
including volunteers and commercial IT firms, around such.

\paragraph{Voters.} Despite the import of all of the aforementioned
stakeholders, truly the most important stakeholder---in fact the one
that holds the veto power over the wide-scale deployment of E2E VIV
technologies---is the voter.

It is clear that many citizens want flexible, comfortable, location
agnostic voting.  It is also clear that they do not realize the
implications of this desire, particularly with regards to the security
and privacy challenges of such a framing.  Educating voters about the
challenges of internet voting is worthwhile, but it is clearly not
possible to make every UOCAVA voter aware of the utility of, and
consequent critical need for, E2EV election systems.

In fact, based upon our early usability studies of E2EV election
systems, it is not even clear that we can expect that a small fraction
of voters to understand and use the verifiability features of such
systems, even if such systems see significant refinement and are
truly usable by all voters.

Voters' trust in their election apparatus, and it transitively impacts
their trust in their sitting government, is paramount. Consequently,
changes in elections that may impact trustworthiness are difficult to
make.

Voters are sensitive to changes that are bluntly visible, like
e-pollbooks or e-voting machines. The DRM revolution and VVPAT redux
have taught some voters to not trust technology at face-value.

Reactions to changes that have the potential to be misunderstood by,
or cause alarm with, a vocal minority are unpredictable. Witness the
introduction of voter ID across the U.S.A. over the past decade, as
well as the alarm raised by the use of email ballot return, even in
extraordinary circumstances like post-Hurricane Sandy elections.

Finally, and perhaps most critically, there is a delicate balance
between comprehensibility and security---the Scylla and Charibdes of
digital election systems. Paper-based elections are viewed as being
transparent and comprehensible. Digital-based election have lost those
properties but, in the right circumstances, gain others like
tabulation efficiency, decreases in residual vote count, and
facilitation of independent voting for disabled voters. Internet
voting again shifts the balance towards voter convenience, with a
significant loss in non-expert comprehensibility, since to the first
significant digit the percentage of voters that are cryptographers is
zero.

Choosing to design and deploy an election system that is end-to-end
secure, and thus based upon cryptographic principles, is a policy
decision that firmly delegates trust and responsibility into the hands
of a precious few.  Those few, on the front lines the elected official
and the politician voting for modernization, and behind-the-scenes,
the cryptographers, scientists, and engineers responsible for the
system's design, development, validation, and verification, have
enormous responsibility in their hands.

\section{Methodology}

In order to transparently and rigorously shoulder this burden in this,
the first phase of the E2E VIV project, Galois has organized the
technical project management in a workflow that focuses on delivering
an evidence-based report and its complementary open source technical
artifacts.  This methodology is summarized as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Absorb all input from experts.}
\item \textbf{Read all literature on Internet voting.}
\item \textbf{Write baseline business and technical requirements and
    solicit feedback from technical experts.}
\item \textbf{Write personas as foundation for UX studies.}
\item \textbf{Interview LEOs based upon requirements and personas;
    include in interview information about their current elections
    framing.}
\item \textbf{Outline report and solicit text and reflections from
    experts.}
\item \textbf{Reflect upon latest advances in cryptography for E2E VIV.}
\item \textbf{Reflect upon latest advances for reasoning about
    cryptography algorithms, protocols, and implementations.}
\item \textbf{Craft a parameterized architecture space that reflect
    underlying requirements and standard cryptographic protocols.}
\item \textbf{Integrate all expert text and reflections and craft a
    final report table of contents.}
\item \textbf{Solicit more text and reflections from experts based
    upon final report table of contents.}
\item \textbf{Write chapters that were as-of-yet unwritten by experts.}
\item \textbf{Solicit input from all experts on Part 1.}
\item \textbf{Solicit input from technical experts on Part 2.}
\item \textbf{Solicit initial reflections from technical experts on
    feasibility of Part 2 potential recommendations.}
\item \textbf{Gather all input from experts (good and bad, nuances,
    disagreements, etc.) and capture all in appendices, citations, and
    footnotes.}
\item \textbf{Identify useful illustrations and figures for report and
    farm out drafting of such to illustrator.}
\item \textbf{Copy-edit, layout, polish, and release report.}
\item \textbf{Cleanup and make public the git repository that includes
  the report and all associated artifacts of the project.}
\end{enumerate}

The outcomes of this process are this report and the reflections of a
body of experts in the domain of verifiable elections, as summarized
in the following section.

\section{Outcome}
\label{sec:outcome}

This project has produced a high-level system specification, in the
form of a set of business and technical requirements.  Accompanying
that set of requirements are recommendations about the underlying
means by which those requirements should be fulfilled.  

These recommendations focus on the three dimensions necessary to
fulfill the very strenuous requirements of any E2EV system:
cryptography, architecture, and engineering.  The cryptographic
foundation is a formal framework in which to evaluate E2EV
cryptographic protocols.  The architecture specification is a formal
description of a parameterized architecture space in which solutions
can be designed, built, and evaluated.  Finally, the rigorous
engineering necessary to create a high-assurance E2E VIV product is
spelled out via a recommended software engineering process,
methodology, and set of technologies which, when used properly, can be
used to fulfill the security and correctness technical requirements
while generating the necessary evidence that the system is
fit-for-purpose.

Given these underlying recommendations, the assessment of the system
by the expert team has had two possible outcomes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Positively:} The majority of the expert team may decide
  that the specified election system meets all of the requirements set
  forth by the charter of the group. This outcome would indicate that
  OVF might potentially move forward to ensure that the election
  system is developed and, potentially, deployed.
\item \textbf{Negatively:} The majority of the expert team may decide
  that the specified election system does not meet all of the
  requirements set forth by the charter of the group. This outcome
  indicates that further funding to design or construct such an
  election system is, for the moment, unwise and that the community
  believes that designing a usable and secure election system is still
  an open scientific, not engineering, challenge.
\end{enumerate}

Fulfilling the usability and security requirements would not be
sufficient for a positive assessment by the expert team. A full system
specification that is usable and secure may be, for example, far too
expensive to build, too difficult to deploy and manage, or mandate too
much expertise from election officials to operate. Social
non-functional requirements may trump technical functional
requirements.

\subsection{User Interface Design}
\label{sec:user-interf-design}

The user interface (or UI for short) of the E2E VIV election system is
the critical factor in ensuring that the system is simultaneously
usable, accessible, and secure. Consequently, a detailed UI design
informed by user experience (UX, for short) and accessibility testing
is a mandatory component of a future detailed system specification.

At the moment, this report's system specification is focused on
high-level requirements for any E2EV election system (internet
voting-based or not).  As such, a number of requirements focus on UI
and UX and stipulate the necessary framing for UI/UX designs and
studies.

Usability and accessibility studies and testing is a key component of
this report, and the outcome of this first study is meant to inform
the UI design of any future E2E VIV systems. As such, most of the
effort relating to UI and UX within the project is focused on
developing a technical infrastructure and complementary process for
the efficient definition and execution of qualitative and quantitative
usability and accessibility studies.

The initial usability study that was conducted gathered qualitative
feedback from several dozen voters.  Based upon that study, whose full
report is included in \autoref{appendix:usability_study}, three
conclusions were reached about voters' mental models about internet
voting.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Voters intrinsically trust the voting system and their
    election officials.}  This trust is both a blessing and a curse.
  A blessing because it means that election officials and the
  government are working with voters that have a positive disposition
  and trust can only be lost and does not need to be won. But it is
  also a curse because it means that voters will trust internet voting
  systems that have no transparency, end-to-end security, or
  verifiability. As such, this opens the door for existing vendors to
  sell their technology and gather naive voter feedback as
  ``evidence'' that their systems are fit-for-purpose for modern
  public elections.
\item \emph{While many voters are supportive of having verifiability
    in their election system, very few voters are interested in
    learning about verifiability and taking the necessary time and
    energy to perform verifiability.} Happily, only a small fraction
  of voters needs to actually verify for most E2E VIV election schemes
  to generate sufficient independent evidence that the election outcome
  is correct. As such, our requirements and recommendations reflect
  this level of voter engagement and suggest several means by which
  the threshold for election verification is always achieved.
  \todokiniry{Make sure requirements for verifiability and our
    recommendations are strengthened given the UX study. -JRK}
\item \emph{Voter expect the internet voting experience to be somehow
    different from a traditional voting experience, be it on paper
    ballot or computer-assisted in a supervised setting.} It was not
  uncommon for voters to say, ``Huh, that's it?!'' after completing
  their voting process. Voters' mental models trained to expect
  modern, rich web surfing experiences a la Facebook, YouTube, and
  Amazon and novel, interactive user experiences on their smart phones
  like Siri, Google Maps, and Uber. Consequently, this raised
  expectation opens the door for novel experimentation for 21st
  century voter experiences.
