Internet voting (IV) is a like an impending wave moving towards voters and elections
officials.  Ensuring that, when it hits us, we have a firm foundation
for trust in our elections---particularly with regards to their
correctness, security, usability, and accessibility---is paramount.

Given the in-depth analysis summarized in this report, the E2E-VIV
Project team involved have produced the following
results, made a concrete set of recommendations, and highlighted next
steps for various related communities.

\section{Results}

As promised in the proposal that created this project,
several deliverables have been produced.  

Primary amongst them is the ``whole product solution'' specification
contained in~\autoref{chapter:required_properties}. This
specification, which comes in the form as a set of mandatory
requirements, is useful to several audiences, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{legislators} and their staff who are interested in
  crafting laws that relate to remote elections, particularly IV
  elections and elections for overseas and military, and disabled voters,
\item \emph{election officials} specifying (via RFIs or RFPs) or
  evaluating IV products or services,
\item \emph{activists} interested in obtaining a better understanding
  of, and advocating for, E2E-VIV systems,
\item \emph{testing organizations} interested in certifying IV
  systems,
\item \emph{standards bodies} interested in standardizing what
  constitutes various classes of IV technologies and how rigorous
  certification of IV systems should be specified,
\item \emph{technologists} interested in implementing E2E-VIV systems.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, this report also includes several other artifacts useful to
a subset of these audiences, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item a cryptographic foundation with which to evaluate and compare
  various E2E protocols and E2E-VIV
  systems~(\autoref{chapter:crypto_spec}),
\item an analysis of the architecture space of E2E-VIV
  systems~(\autoref{chapter:architecture}),
\item precise recommendations on the state-of-the-art for rigorous
  engineering of E2EV systems~(\autoref{cha:rigor-softw-engin}),
\item a framing for an ongoing discussion about the feasibility of
  designing, constructing, certifying, legalizing, and operationalizing
  E2E-VIV systems~(\autoref{chapter:feasibility}), and
\item an analysis of the outstanding issues that must be tackled in
  future stages of this field, including political, legal, research,
  engineering, and business challenges~(\autoref{sec:next-steps}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendation (YES or NO?)}

Synthesizing all of the above information, the E2E-VIV Project team has
come to the following conclusion and set of
recommendations. \todokiniry{This is being dropped into this document
  in this form not because it has been decided, but simply to expedit
  editing and layout as we push to completion.  I am using an edited
  version of Josh's proposed text and ideas here---they do not reflect
  Galois's position in these matters.}

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{center}
  \textbf{\emph{Recommendation I.} We \emph{do not} assert that
    Internet voting (IV) \emph{should} be pursued,\\
    nor do we assert that IV should \emph{never} be pursued.}
\end{center}

There is clearly no consensus for either of these positions.

\begin{center}
  \textbf{\emph{Recommendation II.} Public elections should not be
    conducted over the Internet\\
    using systems that are not end-to-end verifiable.}
\end{center}

Some may say that public elections should not be conducted over the
Internet at all, but we have uniform support as a community of the
assertion above, as opposed to the kind of ``naked'', or vulnerable due their defenselessness, IV that we are
beginning to see today. Non-end-to-end verifiable systems are
irresponsible and should never be used. We all know of the numerous
vulnerabilities of Internet applications, and the idea of voting with
an unverifiable Internet application is alarming, to say the least.
% maybe there is a different way to phrase this. Not sure about the word "alarming"...

\begin{center}
  \textbf{\emph{Recommendation III.} End-to-end verifiable Internet
    voting systems should not be used before end-to-end verifiable
    poll-site voting systems have been widely-deployed and experience
    has been gained from their use.}
\end{center}

Gaining experience with E2E-verifiability in the simpler in-person
setting before attempting the more complex Internet setting seems like
a natural and prudent step, but there is another reason for starting
with in-person systems.  Few jurisdictions are willing to release
separate tallies for their in-person and remote voters, but a
verifiable system needs to publish a tally to be verified.  If only
the remote voters use an E2E-verifiable system, then the sub-tally of
the remote voters must be reported.\footnote{It may be possible to mix
  a small number of not individually-verified remote votes in with
  fully-verified in-person votes in such a way as to produce a single
  universally-verifiable tally, but it is difficult to imagine how the
  reverse might be accomplished in a meaningful way.}
 
The pragmatism in this recommendation is simpler than the technical
justification: The E2E-VIV Project team firmly believe that if we
were to assert that Internet voting cannot be conducted with adequate
security and assurance, then we will be ignored and see widespread use
of deficient, unverifiable Internet voting systems within ten years.
Vendors will claim to have solved the security problems, and eager
officials will buy these systems.  Elections may be altered with no
public awareness, and vendors will assert that they were right and we
were wrong.  If election officials manage to find
evidence left by a careless attacker after altering an election, it
will be a Pyrrhic victory.
 
In making these recommendations, we realize that we have created a
narrow pathway to adoption and assert that no attempt at Internet
voting should deviate from this path.  This path is a difficult one to
follow.  After all, building an in-person E2E-verifiable voting system
is no small task.  After several years, there will be few, if any,
E2E-VIV systems in common use.  But any E2E-VIV system is enormously
better than the vulnerable Internet voting alternatives.  

In addition, we recognize that we get the side-benefit of the
deployment of E2E-verifiable in-person systems, which has the bonus of
improving the integrity of our in-person voting systems.

\begin{center}
  \textbf{Recommendation IV:} E2E-VIV systems must be designed,
  constructed, verified, and certified as high-assurance systems
  according to the most stringent engineering requirements of
  mission-critical and safety-critical systems.
\end{center}
