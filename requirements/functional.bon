  "General functional requirements for digital election systems."

scenario
  "CASTING_ATOMIC" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "Ballot casting should be atomic with respect to server failures."

scenario
  "DETERMINISTIC_VOTING_PROCESS" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "If a server side failure occurs, no voter's balloting can be \
 \ left in an intermediate state."

scenario
  "BALLOT_FINAL_STATES" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "Either a ballot is securely and completely cast and the \
 \ voter is marked as having voted, or no ballot is recorded and the \
 \ voter is not marked as having voted."

scenario
  "VOTE_RECORD_MONOTONICITY" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "If the system and the law allows a voter to cast multiple votes \
 \ with only the last one counting, or to cast a partial ballot with \
 \ the option of modifying it later, then each voting session must be \
 \ atomic with respect to server failures. If a failure occurs during the \
 \ voter's last session, then the votes cast as of his or her previous \
 \ session will count."

scenario
  "RECEIPT_FREEDOM" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "There must be no way for voters to prove to another party any \
 \ information regarding how they voted in any race (beyond what is \
 \ mathematically deducible from the final distribution of votes)."
  -- dmz: I believe this to be impossible with an Internet voting
  -- system - as it is, in fact, today at regular polling places -
  -- because a voter can simply videorecord their screen with an 
  -- external camera, such as on their cellphone, as they vote
  
scenario
  "VALID_BALLOT_PROVENANCE" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "Once it is determined that a ballot will be counted, the ballot \
 \ should be irrevocably separated from the identification of the \
 \ voter who cast it.  It must be information theoretically impossible \
 \ to determine who cast a particular ballot, or what ballot was cast \
 \ by a particular voter."
 
scenario
  "MULTI_BALLOT_RECORD" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "If the voting system permits voters to modify or replace their \
 \ previously cast ballots, the system should retain only the latest \
 \ votes in each race, and retain no record of the previous modified \
 \ votes."

scenario
  "NO_DOUBLE_VOTE" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "But for systems supporting MULTI_BALLOT_RECORD, the voting system \
 \ should not record more than one vote for any voter in any race."

scenario
  "NO_ADVERTISING" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "The voting system client must not display or permit the display of \
 \ any advertising or commercial logos in the window that contains the \
 \ voting session, other than those of the election jurisdiction \
 \ itself."

scenario
  "NO_EXTERNAL_LINKS" -- @ref David Jefferson
description
  "The voting system client must not display any links to other sites \
 \ except for help in the mechanics of voting."
