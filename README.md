## Road Show Slides

Prior to the project being complete, Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat and Joe
Kiniry went on a "Road Show" to visit several of the LEOs involved in
the project and LEOs in their area.  We visited Washington D.C.,
Seattle WA, Portland OR, and Santa Fe NM.  A set of slides were
presented at these events.

The focus of the presentation was:
 1. summarizing the E2E-VIV project,
 2. dispelling myths about internet voting,
 3. explaining what end-to-end verifiable internet voting is to a lay
 audience,
 4. summarizing the current state of the project, where we were
 heading, when to expect the report, and a range of recommendations
 were possible, and
 5. answering any questions that attendees had about elections.

As such, the slides used were only understandable within the context
of the interactive presentation, and cannot be interpreted without
hearing the presentation.  Unfortunately, there are Internet voting
proponents who are accidentally or willfully misinterpreting that
content now.  This should be stopped and any and all instances of such
misinterpretation will be aggressively rebutted by Joe Kiniry and
expert team members.  These slides are currently archived for
historical purposes in the "slides" sub-directory of this repository.

Know that *only the final report* and its Executive Summary contains
the opinions of the team and the recommendations of the project.
